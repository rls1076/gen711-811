1. Review, fastqc
2. Redirection and pipes lesson
3. Script writing

## review

## keypoints
Employ the grep command to search for information within files.
Print the results of a command to a file.
Construct command pipelines with two or more stages.
Use for loops to run the same command for several input files.


## questions for practical
How can I search within files?
How can I combine existing commands to do new things?



## HELP: Nucleotide abbreviations
The four nucleotides that appear in DNA are abbreviated A, C, T and G. Unknown nucleotides are represented with the letter N. An N appearing in a sequencing file represents a position where the sequencing machine was not able to confidently determine the nucleotide in that position. You can think of an N as being aNy nucleotide at that position in the DNA sequence.


## Exercise 1

1. Search for the sequence `GNATNACCACTTCC` in the `SRR098026.fastq` file.
  Have your search return all matching lines and the name (or identifier) for each sequence
  that contains a match.

2. Search for the sequence `AAGTT` in both FASTQ files.
  Have your search return all matching lines and the name (or identifier) for each sequence
  that contains a match.

3. How do the search results differ when matching in one file vs. both files? If you wanted to keep the original FASTQ format, how would you get around this?

## Exercise 2

How many sequences are there in `SRR098026.fastq`? Remember that every sequence is formed by four lines.

## Exercise 3

How many sequences in `SRR098026.fastq` contain at least 3 consecutive Ns?

## Exercise 4

Print the file prefix of all of the `.txt` files in our current directory.

## Exercise 5

After renaming the fastqs as demonstrated, remove `_2026` from all of the `.txt` files.

## Exercise 6

We want the script to tell us when it's done.

1. Open `bad-reads-script.sh` and add the line `echo "Script finished!"` after the `grep` command and save the file.
2. Run the updated script.




## keypoints

- `grep` is a powerful search tool with many options for customization.
- `>`, `>>`, and `|` are different ways of redirecting output.
- `command > file` redirects a command's output to a file.
- `command >> file` redirects a command's output to a file without overwriting the existing contents of the file.
- `command_1 | command_2` redirects the output of the first command as input to the second command.
- `for` loops are used for iteration.
- `basename` gets rid of repetitive parts of names.
